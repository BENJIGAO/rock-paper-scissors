This project is a re-creation of the game rock-paper-scissors but with a twist: it contains a storyline. Rather than simply playing against a computer, this computer, as the little animation in the beginning is trying to tell, has become intelligent and is trying to kill you. The only way to survive is by winning a first-to-five game of rock-paper-scissors. Although the website a little unprofessional (quite silly honestly), I hope you like it!
