# Rock-Paper-Scissors (but with a twist!!!)

As the title suggests, this is no ordinary rock-paper-scissors. Rather than simply playing against a computer, this computer, as the little animation in the beginning is trying to tell, has become intelligent and is trying to kill you! The only way to survive is by winning a best of 11 game of rock-paper-scissors. Although the website a little unprofessional and quite silly, I had a blast making it. I hope you like it!
