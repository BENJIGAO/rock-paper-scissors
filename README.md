# Rock-Paper-Scissors (but with a twist!!!)

As the title suggests, this is no ordinary rock-paper-scissors. Rather than simply playing against a computer, this computer, as animation in the beginning implies (click on github pages to view it live), has become intelligent and is trying to kill you! The only way to survive is by winning a best of 11 game of rock-paper-scissors. Although the website a little unprofessional and quite silly, I had a blast making it. I hope you like it!
